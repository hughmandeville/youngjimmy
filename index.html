        Christopher 'YOUNG JIMMY' Beckwith is a 33-year-old Guitarist, Rapper, Singer-Song Writer, Producer, Graphic
        Designer, and Video Editor based in Brooklyn, NY. Raised in The Bronx, East Chester Garden's located in the
        poorest, Congressional District 16, is Notoriously known for the largest gang takedown in New York City
        history. Young Jimmy picked up the guitar at age 6. A high school dropout, he attended the Art & Design High
        School class of 2006 and attended Greenwich House Music School. Studied Classical, Jazz, and Rock music
        performed monthly recitals under a scholarship.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 19, he moved to the original House of Yes. Working as a Lead Guitarist for various Rock and Hip Hop
        acts
        in the New York City area. House of Yes would later burn down in a fire with half of his musical equipment
        caused by ex-girlfriend negligence. Poverty and homelessness made life a constant struggle. In unfortunate
        times
        he slept on trains and park benches. Coming of age, influenced by 2pac, Andre 3000, Thin Lizzy, RHCP, The
        Police, Micheal Jackson, Prince, STP, Raekwon, Nirvana, Run-D.M.C, Sublime, MF Doom, Rage Against the Machine,
        Jimmy Page, and Jimi Hendrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2009 Young Jimmy recorded an EP called 'To My Chagrin' with an all-black indie-rock band 'Sankofa' with
        producer-engineer Paul Mahajan. 'Sankofa' name comes from Ghana means "go back and get it" we must look back
        to
        our past so that we may understand how we became what we are and move forward to a better future. Cocaine,
        ego,
        and women ended the band 3-year run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in The Bronx, rock music was not the norm by no means the birthplace of Hip Hop. Young Jimmy was
        the
        juxtapose to an environment dominated by Hip Hop, gangs, guns, violence, and Building fires. Raised by a
        single
        mother in public housing with three siblings, his stepfather was Hip Hop Legend, and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer
        Grand Master Mele Mel helped nurture his musical ambitions. Introduced Young Jimmy to the music industry and
        accompanied Mele Mel on a few sold-out shows playing guitar. Young Jimmy describes his style of music as Hood
        Rock, a Rap-Rock alternative rock subgenre.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young Jimmy has shared the stage and opened for: Kendrick Lamar, Big Krit, Freddie Gibbs, Saul Williams, Talib
        Kweli & Michelle Williams, Smoke Dza, Res, Ces Cru, Tanya Morgan, Lil Debbie, Jah C & The Antidote, Jay
        Boogie,
        Caviliar, Doodlebug of Digable Planets, and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afro-Punk documentary by filmmaker James Spooner best describes the 'Black Rocker' experience. Black people
        created rock music in the early 1950s. For the last 50 years, the genre has been dominated and appropriated by
        white people mainly, white men. Here are excerpts from Jack Hamilton's book 'Just Around Midnight' speaks to
        the
        plight of the 'Black Rocker'-
      </p>
      <p>
        "Being a white man had become preconditioned for making "real" rock music."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No black derived musical form in American history has more assiduously moved to erase and blockade
        participation than rock music."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Which brings us to the third, and by far most common, way that the "whitening" of rock and roll music has
        been discussed, Simply not at all."
      </p>
      <p>
        Young Jimmy's debut studio album sets the record straight, due to be released in, 2021 allows listeners to
        dive
        into his 'raw' unfiltered "HOOD ROCK" fusion sound. His perspective will force listeners to confront the stark
        reality in these tumultuous times in American History.Christopher 'YOUNG JIMMY' Beckwith is a 33-year-old
