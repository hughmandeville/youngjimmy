          Christopher 'YOUNG JIMMY' Beckwith is a 33-year-old Guitarist, Rapper, Singer-Song Writer, Producer, Graphic
          Designer, and Video Editor based in Brooklyn, NY. Raised in The Bronx, East Chester Garden's located in the
          poorest, Congressional District 16, is Notoriously known for the largest gang takedown in New York City
          history. Young Jimmy picked up the guitar at age 6. A high school dropout, he attended the Art & Design High
          School class of 2006 and attended Greenwich House Music School. Studied Classical, Jazz, and Rock music
          performed monthly recitals under a scholarship.
        </p>
        <p>
          At age 19, he moved to the original House of Yes. Working as a Lead Guitarist for various Rock and Hip Hop
          acts
          in the New York City area. House of Yes would later burn down in a fire with half of his musical equipment
          caused by ex-girlfriend negligence. Poverty and homelessness made life a constant struggle. In unfortunate
          times
          he slept on trains and park benches. Coming of age, influenced by 2pac, Andre 3000, Thin Lizzy, RHCP, The
          Police, Micheal Jackson, Prince, STP, Raekwon, Nirvana, Run-D.M.C, Sublime, MF Doom, Rage Against the Machine,
          Jimmy Page, and Jimi Hendrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009 Young Jimmy recorded an EP called 'To My Chagrin' with an all-black indie-rock band 'Sankofa' with
          producer-engineer Paul Mahajan. 'Sankofa' name comes from Ghana means "go back and get it" we must look back
          to
          our past so that we may understand how we became what we are and move forward to a better future. Cocaine,
          ego,
          and women ended the band 3-year run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up in The Bronx, rock music was not the norm by no means the birthplace of Hip Hop. Young Jimmy was
          the
          juxtapose to an environment dominated by Hip Hop, gangs, guns, violence, and Building fires. Raised by a
          single
          mother in public housing with three siblings, his stepfather was Hip Hop Legend, and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer
          Grand Master Mele Mel helped nurture his musical ambitions. Introduced Young Jimmy to the music industry and
          accompanied Mele Mel on a few sold-out shows playing guitar. Young Jimmy describes his style of music as Hood
          Rock, a Rap-Rock alternative rock subgenre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Young Jimmy has shared the stage and opened for: Kendrick Lamar, Big Krit, Freddie Gibbs, Saul Williams, Talib
          Kweli & Michelle Williams, Smoke Dza, Res, Ces Cru, Tanya Morgan, Lil Debbie, Jah C & The Antidote, Jay
          Boogie,
          Caviliar, Doodlebug of Digable Planets, and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afro-Punk documentary by filmmaker James Spooner best describes the 'Black Rocker' experience. Black people
          created rock music in the early 1950s. For the last 50 years, the genre has been dominated and appropriated by
          white people mainly, white men. Here are excerpts from Jack Hamilton's book 'Just Around Midnight' speaks to
          the
          plight of the 'Black Rocker'-
        </p>
        <p>
          "Being a white man had become preconditioned for making "real" rock music."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No black derived musical form in American history has more assiduously moved to erase and blockade
          participation than rock music."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Which brings us to the third, and by far most common, way that the "whitening" of rock and roll music has
          been discussed, Simply not at all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Young Jimmy's debut studio album sets the record straight, due to be released in, 2021 allows listeners to
          dive
          into his 'raw' unfiltered "HOOD ROCK" fusion sound. His perspective will force listeners to confront the stark
          reality in these tumultuous times in American History.Christopher 'YOUNG JIMMY' Beckwith is a 33-year-old
